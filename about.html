      <h3>Front-end Developer from Colorado Springs, CO</h3>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about building creative, user-friendly web applications
        and exploring how technology connects people. Coding is built on binary
        (0s and 1s), and there are over 700 programming languages in use today.
        <br /><br />
        Fun fact: the first computer “bug” was a literal moth discovered in
        1947, and Ada Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer for
        her work in the 1840s.
